<strong>Here’s a Quick Overview:</strong><br><br>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Start the Game</strong>: Players roll the dice and move their token on the board, landing on different properties.</li>

 	<li><strong>Pay Rent and Fees</strong>: If you land on a property owned by someone else, you must pay rent.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bankrupting Opponents</strong>: The ultimate goal is to bankrupt your opponents by making them unable to pay rent or afford properties.</li>
</ol>
